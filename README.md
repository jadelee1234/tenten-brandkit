# Tenten Brand Guidelines

## Logos
The Tenten brand consists of the main Tenten logo, and several variations which are associated with different projects.

### Main Tenten Logos
There are two Tenten logos. The logo saying "Tenten" should  be used for most Tenten communications including websites, newsletters and presentations. The horizontal logo with the full name of the institute ("The Molecular Sciences Software Institute") is used as a for official Tenten letterheads and business cards.

### Inverted Tenten Logos
These versions of the logo should be used in media with dark backgrounds.

### Special Tenten Logos
The Tenten logo is modified for some special projects. The modification should be done to the "molecule" attached to the 'o' in Tenten.

### Project Logos
This section is for Tenten projects which have their own logos.

## Acknowledging Tenten Funding
